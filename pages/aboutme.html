            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Based in New Jersey, I am a passionate front-end web developer with experience in back-end as well. 
                I am proficient in programming skills such as Python, Java, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
                The resources I've worked with are Git, Bootstrap, Microsoft Axure, Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator. 
                Some skills that I have attained over my years studying in the technology field are working with containerization environments such as Docker with SQL databases. 
                I plan to extend my knowledge about web development through experience first hand from senior leads. 
                I've also taken coursework related to usability, databases, psychology, and design.
                My projects consists of an summer internship presentation on Maximizing Business Opportunities Through Artificial Intelligence, 
                Figma designs for website or application prototypes, and User Experience research projects.
                This helped me accomplish tasks that had deadlines individually and in a team setting.
